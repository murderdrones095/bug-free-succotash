I thought I was coming for a car wash, not a crash course in patience. You’ve got traffic jams that even the LA freeway can’t compete with!

This place isn’t a car wash, it’s a parking lot for my frustration.

I didn’t know I signed up for a waiting marathon. Do you hand out medals for this kind of patience?

If I wanted to experience a traffic jam, I’d just go to rush hour on the freeway, not a car wash.

I came to get my car cleaned, not to practice deep breathing exercises to keep from losing my mind!

The only thing more packed than this car wash is my calendar with all the things I could have done instead of waiting here!

This car wash has more roadblocks than a game of Monopoly!

Is this a car wash or a game of 'how long can you hold your bladder while waiting'?

Your car wash should come with a free coffee because we’ll all be here long enough to need one!

At this rate, I’ll be driving through your car wash in reverse just to avoid the endless traffic ahead.

You should call this a 'waiting experience,' not a car wash. It’s more of a patience test.

I thought the car wash was supposed to clean my car, not test my sanity with these traffic jams!

At least the car wash has some action—just not the kind I’m looking for. It’s like bumper cars out here!

You’d think with all this waiting, you could at least offer me a seat with a view, like a VIP section for patience!

I came for a wash; it’s turning into a crash course in traffic management. Maybe you should give me a certificate after all this!

Your car wash line moves slower than a turtle trying to run a marathon.

You guys should hand out free maps here to help us navigate through all this traffic!

I came to get my car clean, but now I feel like I’m in a reality show: 'Survive the Washiez Traffic Jam.'

You know, I thought the point of a car wash was getting rid of dirt, not making me feel like I’m stuck in a never-ending line!

It’s so backed up here, I’m starting to think you guys are washing cars and running a parking service at the same time!
