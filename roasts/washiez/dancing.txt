You’re dancing like you’re the main character in a music video, but your car wash skills are still buffering.

I came here for a clean car, not a front-row seat to your TikTok audition.

You’re dancing like you’ve got rhythm, but your work ethic’s off-beat.

You should’ve stayed in dance class — the car wash isn’t a stage, it's a job.

If you spent as much time cleaning as you do dancing, maybe we'd get through the line faster.

That dance move's as smooth as the car wash... which is to say, not at all.

You’re out here doing the worm while I’m trying to get my car towed into the actual wash.

You must be dancing to forget you’re supposed to be working.

I didn’t know ‘flossing’ was part of the car wash service — can you focus though?

You’re dancing like you’re auditioning for So You Think You Can Wait, but I'm just trying to get a clean car.
